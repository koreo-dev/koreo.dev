Workflows are used to implement multi-step processes. This could be something
as simple as automating a deployment or something as complex as automating
entire internal developer platforms, cloud environments, or infrastructure
control planes. Workflows, in combination with [Functions](./overview/glossary.md#function),
provide a means for programming or orchestrating Kubernetes [controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/).
This could be Kubernetes "built-in" controllers, such as Deployment or Job
controllers, "off-the-shelf" controllers, such as GCP's [Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview)
or AWS's [ACK](https://aws-controllers-k8s.github.io/community/docs/community/overview/),
or custom controllers you've built yourself. Workflows enable you to build
automations around these controllers or compose them into cohesive platforms.

Workflows specify which Functions should be run, how their outputs map into
inputs, and manages their execution. In essence, Workflows themselves define a
controller. That is, Workflow is a control-loop-driven workflow orchestrator.
For this reason, we sometimes refer to Koreo as a "meta-controller programming
language" because Workflows and Functions provide controller-based primitives
for managing other controllers.

In general, Workflow definitions are simple. They specify the resource type
that will cause the Workflow to run, i.e. the "trigger", provide configuration
values to the entry point, perform a set of steps, and optionally surface
conditions or state. Think of a Workflow as a specification which is
_instantiated_ with configuration. Once instantiated, an instance of the
Workflow will run according to its configuration. Many instances of a Workflow
may exist and run concurrently. Many Workflows may be defined within one
system, and Workflows themselves may be composed.

A Workflow is responsible for running [Logic](./overview/glossary.md#logic), which is a
[ValueFunction](./value-function.md),
[ResourceFunction](./resource-function.md), or another Workflow. Logic should
be thought of as defining the body of a loop. The Workflow schedules iterations
of that loop and manages the "external" (to that Logic's body) state
interactions.

## Running a Workflow

A Workflow may be _externally_ triggered to run, and have its _configuration_
provided by a resource specified using [`crdRef`](#speccrdref).
This resource serves to provide the Workflow's configuration and the Workflow
instance may optionally report its conditions and state within this resource's
`status` block.

```yaml {7-10}
apiVersion: koreo.dev/v1beta1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: simple-example.v1
  namespace: koreo-demo
spec:
  crdRef:
    apiGroup: demo.koreo.dev
    version: v1beta1
    kind: TriggerDummy
  # ...
```

We refer to the _instance_ of the `crdRef` resource which _triggers_ a
Workflow as its "parent" or "trigger".

:::warning
Any resource kind can be used as a Workflow trigger, but take care when using
resources controlled by another controller. Koreo applies updates to the
resource's status and annotations which could result in a dangerous interaction
for resources with specific semantics used by another controller. For this
reason, it's encouraged to create your own CRDs unless you understand what
you are doing. [Koreo Tooling](./getting-started/tooling-installation.md)
provides a tool to generate a CRD from a Workflow.
:::

Additionally, a Workflow can be triggered by _another_ Workflow as a
sub-Workflow. This is done by specifying a
[`ref`](#specstepsindexref) with `kind: Workflow` on a step in the parent
Workflow.

```yaml {8-14}
apiVersion: koreo.dev/v1beta1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: simple-example.v1
  namespace: koreo-demo
spec:
  steps:
    - label: nested_workflow
      ref:
        kind: Workflow
        name: nested-workflow.v1
      inputs:
        string: =steps.config.string
        int: =steps.config.int
  # ...
```

## Defining the Logic

Each step defines some Logic to be called, specifies the inputs the Logic is
to be provided with, specifies an optional status condition, and optionally
specifies any state you wish exposed within the parent resource's
`status.state`.

Each step must specify the Logic to be called. Logic is defined by
ValueFunction, ResourceFunction, or using a sub-Workflow to compose Functions.
To _reference_ the Logic, you specify the `kind` and `name`. Logic may be
statically specified using `ref`, which specifies exact Logic to run. Logic may
be dynamically selected from a fixed set of references using `refSwitch`, which
provides the ability to select between multiple Logics which implement a
compatible interfaceâ€”this is discussed in more detail below.

:::tip[Steps may run concurrently]
A step is run once all steps it references have been run. To help make
the sequencing clearer, you are required to list steps after any step(s) they
reference. Note that steps may run concurrently as their dependencies complete,
so you should not depend on the order in which they are listed.
:::

Steps also specifies `inputs` to be provided to the Logic. Within Functions,
the inputs are directly accessible within `inputs`. Within Workflows, the
inputs are exposed under `parent`. This enables a Workflow to be directly
triggered via a `crdRef` _or_ it may be directly called as a sub-Workflow.
That makes reuse and testing of Workflows easier. Steps can depend on other
steps by referencing them as an input value. This allows you to map outputs
from one step into inputs of another step.

:::tip[Avoiding tight coupling]
The parent resource can be passed as an input to steps from a Workflow with
`=parent`. However, rather than passing the entire parent resource to steps,
it's recommended to pass only what is needed from the parent to avoid tightly
coupling Logic to triggering resources. For example, `=parent.metadata` rather
than `=parent` if only the metadata is needed by a Function.
:::

A step may also specify a `forEach` block, which will cause the Logic to be
executed once per item in the `forEach.itemIn` list. Each item will be provided
within `inputs` with the key name specified in `forEach.inputKey`. This makes
using any Function within a `forEach` viable.

Steps may be conditionally run using `skipIf`. When the `skipIf` evaluates to
true, the step and its dependencies are [Skipped](overview/glossary.md#skip)
without resulting in an error by stopping further evaluation of the step and
its dependencies.

`skipIf` enables the Workflow to dynamically determine which steps to run.
This allows Logic to define a common interface, then for the Workflow to call
the correct Logic. This enables _if_ or _switch_ statement semantics.

Logic may be dynamically selected from a set of choices using `refSwitch`.
`refSwitch` allows Logic to define a common interface, then for the
Workflow to call the appropriate Logic based on input or computed values. The
`switchOn` expression has access to the return values from prior steps within
`steps`. It also has access to the `inputs` that will be provided to the Logic.
Using `inputs` enables `refSwitch` to work with `forEach` and dispatch the
correct Logic for each item.

A step may expose a Condition on the parent resource using `condition`. The
Condition's type will match `condition.type`, and this should be unique within
your Workflow. Note that uniqueness is intentionally not enforced so that you
may update / change conditions subsequently, but you should be cautious about
reusing the same type since it makes debugging much harder. `condition.name` is
used within the condition message sentence to make human-friendly status
messages. It should be a meaningful name or _short_ descriptive phrase.

:::warning
Be careful not to accidentally step on the `condition.type` value as it makes
debugging much harder and reduces visibility into a Workflow's status.
:::

The Logic's results may be exposed via the `state` key. The
[Koreo Expressions](./expressions.md) within the Workflow step may access the
Logic's return value within `value`. If specified, `state` must be a mapping
and it will be _merged_ with other `step.state` values. This allows for fine
control over what and how state is exposed.

:::warning
If multiple steps set the same state keys, the return values will be merged.
This can lead to confusing values, so be cautious.

## Example

The following Workflow demonstrates some of the capabilities. Refer to the

spec:

  # Creation, modification, or deletion of a TriggerDummy will trigger
  # this Workflow to run. That is, this Workflow will act as a controller of
  # this resource type. An instance of this resource type is referred to as the
  # "parent" resource for a Workflow.

  steps:
    # Each step must have a label, which acts as an identifier. The return
    # value of the Logic is available to be passed into other steps' inputs as
