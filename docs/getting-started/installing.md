### VS Code Extension

After you have installed Core and the Language Server, using VS Code is as simple as installing the plugin.

You can install the latest-published version of the Koreo Language Server VS Code extension directly from VS Code. Simply open the extensions panel and search for “koreo-ls”.

It will assume your language server is at `/usr/local/bin/koreo-ls`, if you want to override it at `Preferences → Settings → Koreo Language Server` or setting it in your settings.json file.
